# Crony Skill

Manage cron jobs with natural language scheduling.

## Installation Check

```bash
crony --help
```

If not installed:
```bash
uv tool install agentcli-helpers
```

## Usage

### Add a Job
```bash
crony add <name> <schedule> <command>
```

### List Jobs
```bash
crony list
crony list --json
```

### Remove Job
```bash
crony rm <name>
```

### Run Job Now
```bash
crony run <name>
```

### View Logs
```bash
crony logs <name>
```

## Schedule Formats

### One-off Jobs
```bash
crony add backup "in 5m" "backup.sh"
crony add report "at 15:30" "send_report.py"
crony add deploy "on 2026-03-10" "deploy.sh"
```

### Recurring Jobs
```bash
crony add ping "every 1h" "curl http://api/ping"
crony add cleanup "every 24h" "cleanup.sh"
crony add weekly "every monday" "weekly_report.sh"
crony add weekday "every weekday" "daily_check.py"
```

### Interval Syntax
- `in 5m`, `in 1h`, `in 2d` - Relative one-off
- `at 15:30`, `at "2026-03-10 10:00"` - Absolute one-off
- `every 1h`, `every 30m`, `every 24h` - Interval recurring
- `every monday`, `every weekday`, `every weekend` - Day-based recurring

## Examples

```bash
# Health check every hour
crony add health "every 1h" "curl -s http://localhost:8080/health"

# Daily backup
crony add backup "every 24h" "/home/user/backup.sh"

# Weekly report
crony add report "every friday" "python generate_report.py"

# One-time reminder
crony add remind "in 30m" "notify 'Meeting' 'Team sync in 5 min!'"
```

## Platform Support

Jobs are registered with the native OS scheduler:
- **Linux/macOS**: Uses `crontab`
- **Windows**: Uses Task Scheduler

Job metadata is stored in `~/.crony/jobs.json` for easy management.
